### Overview

This package aims to support the construction of Abundance-based species distribution models, including data preparation, model fitting, prediction, and model exploration. The package offers several modeling approaches (i.e., algorithms) that users can fine-tune and customize. Models can be predicted in geographic space and explored regarding performance and response curves. Because modeling workflows in ***adm*** are constructed based on a combination of distinct functions and simple outputs, ***adm*** can be easily integrated into other packages.

### Structure of adm

***adm*** functions are grouped in three categories: modeling, post-modeling, and miscellaneous tools
